### Useage
Once installed, you will find the program "SIMRAD" in the program menu 
of the calculator.

Eight inputs are expected in the following format (not inputting radix):
`(a√b + c√d)(e√f + g√h)`

### Install

You can find a compiled build on the [releases].

The 8xp file will need to be transfered to the calculator. 
This can be done through [TI Connect] for a physical calclator or just 
by dragging it into the window if using Wabbitemu.
